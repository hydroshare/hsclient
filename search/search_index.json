Aggregation Operation Examples The following code snippets show examples for how to use the HS RDF HydroShare Python Client to manipulate aggregations of known content types in HydroShare. HydroShare's content type aggregations include individual file, fileset, time series, geographic feature, geographic raster, and multidimensional NetCDF. Install the HS RDF Python Client The HS RDF Python Client for HydroShare won't be installed by default, so it has to be installed first before you can work with it. Use the following command to install the Python Client from the GitHub repository. Eventually we will distribute this package via the Python Package Index (PyPi) so that it can be installed via pip from PyPi. ! pip install hsclient Authenticating with HydroShare Before you start interacting with resources in HydroShare you will need to authenticate. from hsclient import HydroShare hs = HydroShare () hs . sign_in () Create a New Empty Resource A \"resource\" is a container for your content in HydroShare. Think of it as a \"working directory\" into which you are going to organize the code and/or data you are using and want to share. The following code can be used to create a new, empty resource within which you can create content and metadata. This code creates a new resource in HydroShare. It also creates an in-memory object representation of that resource in your local environmment that you can then manipulate with further code. # Create the new, empty resource new_resource = hs . create () # Get the HydroShare identifier for the new resource resIdentifier = new_resource . resource_id print ( 'The HydroShare Identifier for your new resource is: ' + resIdentifier ) # Construct a hyperlink for the new resource print ( 'Your new resource is available at: ' + new_resource . metadata . url ) Resource Aggregation Handling HydroShare allows you to create and manage aggregations of content files within resources that have specific types and associated metadata. These known content types include: Time series Geographic feature Geographic raster Multidimensional NetCDF Single file File set The general process for creating an aggregation within a resource requires adding files to the resource and then applying the appropriate aggregation type. For some of the aggregation types, some of the aggregation metadata fields will be automatically extracted from the files you upload. You can then set the values of the other aggregation-level metadata elements. Create a Single File Aggregation A single file aggregation in a HydroShare is any individual file to which you want to add extra metadata. # Import the aggregation types from hsmodels.schemas.enums import AggregationType # Upload a single content file to the resource. This is a generic sample comma separated # values (CSV) data file with some tabular data new_resource . file_upload ( 'Example_Files/Data_File1.csv' ) # Specify the file you want to add the aggregation to file = new_resource . file ( path = \"Data_File1.csv\" ) # Create a single file aggregation on the file and refresh the resource agg = new_resource . file_aggregate ( file , AggregationType . SingleFileAggregation ) # Print the title for the aggregation that was added to the resource print ( 'The following aggregation was added to the resource: ' + agg . metadata . title ) print ( 'Aggregation type: ' + agg . metadata . type ) Add Metadata to the Aggregation Once you have created an aggregation, you can edit and add metadata elements. For a single file aggregation, you can add a title, subject keywords, extended metadata as key-value pairs, and spatial and temporal coverage. All of the metadata edits are stored locally until you call the save() function on the aggregation to write the edits you have made to HydroShare. Title and Keywords The title of an aggregation is a string. Subject keywords are handled as a list of strings. # Set the title and subject keywords for the aggregation agg . metadata . title = \"A CSV Data File Single File Aggregation\" agg . metadata . subjects = [ 'CSV' , 'Aggregation' , 'Single File' , 'Data' ] # Print the title and keywords for the aggregation print ( 'Aggregation Title: ' + agg . metadata . title ) print ( 'Aggregation Keywords: ' + ', ' . join ( agg . metadata . subjects )) # Save the aggregation to write all of the metadata to HydroShare agg . save () Extended Metadata Elements Extended metadata elements for an aggregation are handled using a Python dictionary. You can add new elements using key-value pairs. # Add an extended metadata element to the aggregation as a key-value pair agg . metadata . additional_metadata [ 'New Element Key' ] = 'Text value of new element.' # Remove an individual key-value pair from the aggregation using its key del agg . metadata . additional_metadata [ 'New Element Key' ] # Or, you can clear out all of the extended metadata elements that might exist agg . metadata . additional_metadata . clear () # Add multiple key-value pairs to the aggregation at once using a Python dictionary agg . metadata . additional_metadata = { 'Observed Variable' : 'Water use' , 'Site Location' : 'Valley View Tower Dormatory on Utah State University \\' s Campus in Logan, UT' } # Print the extended metadata elements print ( 'The extended metadata elements for the aggregation include:' ) for key , value in agg . metadata . additional_metadata . items (): print ( key + ':' , value ) # Save the aggregation to write all of the metadata to HydroShare agg . save () Spatial and Temporal Coverage Spatial and temporal coverage for an aggregation are handled in the same way they are handled for resource level metadata. Initially the spatial and temporal coverage for an aggregation are empty. To set them, you have to create a coverage object of the right type and set the spatial or temporal coverage to that object. # Import the required metadata classes for coverage objects from hsmodels.schemas.fields import BoxCoverage , PointCoverage , PeriodCoverage from datetime import datetime # Set the spatial coverage of the aggregation to a BoxCoverage object agg . metadata . spatial_coverage = BoxCoverage ( name = 'Logan, Utah' , northlimit = 41.7910 , eastlimit =- 111.7664 , southlimit = 41.6732 , westlimit =- 111.9079 , projection = 'WGS 84 EPSG:4326' , type = 'box' , units = 'Decimal degrees' ) # You can remove the spatial coverage element by setting it to None agg . metadata . spatial_coverage = None # If you want to set the spatial coverage to a PointCoverage instead agg . metadata . spatial_coverage = PointCoverage ( name = 'Logan, Utah' , north = 41.7371 , east =- 111.8351 , projection = 'WGS 84 EPSG:4326' , type = 'point' , units = 'Decimal degrees' ) # Create a beginning and ending date for a time period beginDate = datetime . strptime ( '2020-12-01T00:00:00Z' , '%Y-%m- %d T%H:%M:%S %f Z' ) endDate = datetime . strptime ( '2020-12-31T00:00:00Z' , '%Y-%m- %d T%H:%M:%S %f Z' ) # Set the temporal coverage of the aggregation to a PeriodCoverage object agg . metadata . period_coverage = PeriodCoverage ( start = beginDate , end = endDate ) # Print the temporal coverage information print ( 'Temporal Coverage' ) print ( agg . metadata . period_coverage ) # Print the spatial coverage information print ( ' \\n Spatial Coverage' ) print ( agg . metadata . spatial_coverage ) # Save the aggregation to write all of the metadata to HydroShare agg . save () Creating Other Aggregation Types Geographic Feature Aggregation Geographic feature aggregations are created in HydroShare from the set of files that make up an ESRI Shapefile. You need to upload the shapefile and then HydroShare will automatically set the aggregation on the set of files you upload. You can then retrieve the aggregation using its title or by searching for one of the files it contains. # Create a list of the files that make up the shapefile to be uploaded file_list = [ 'Example_Files/watersheds.cpg' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.dbf' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.prj' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.sbn' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.sbx' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.shp' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.shx' , 'Example_Files/watersheds.shp.xml' ] # Upload the files to the resource all at the same time new_resource . file_upload ( * file_list ) print ( 'Files uploaded!' ) If you upload all of the files of a shapefile together as shown above, HydroShare automatically recognizes the files as a shapefile and auto-aggregates the files into a geographic feature aggregation for you. So, you then just need to get the aggregation that was created if you want to further operate on it - e.g., to modify the aggregation-level metadata. Metadata for a geographic feature aggregation includes a title, subject keywords, extended key-value pairs, temporal coverage, spatial coverage, geometry information, spatial reference, and field information. When HydroShare creates the aggregation on the shapefile, the spatial coverage, geometry information, spatial reference, and attribute field information metadata will be automatically set for you. You can then set all of the other metadata elements as shown above for the single file aggregation if you need to. # Get the aggregation that was just created # You can get the aggregation by searching for a file that is inside of it agg = new_resource . aggregation ( file__name = \"watersheds.shp\" ) # Or, you can get the aggregation by searching for its title, which is initially # set to the name of the shapefile agg = new_resource . aggregation ( title = \"watersheds\" ) # Print the title for the aggregation that was added to the resource print ( 'The following aggregation was added to the resource: ' + agg . metadata . title ) print ( 'Aggregation type: ' + agg . metadata . type ) Geographic Raster Aggregation Geographic raster aggregations are created in HydroShare from one or more raster data files that make up a raster dataset. HydroShare uses GeoTiff files for raster datasets. Like the geographic feature aggregation, when you upload all of the files for a geographic raster dataset (all .tif and a .vrt file) at once, HydroShare will automatically create the aggregation for you. You can then get the aggregation and set the other metadata elements as shown above for the single file aggregation. HydroShare initially sets the title of the geographic raster aggregation to the first .tif file that appears in the .vrt file. The spatial coverage, spatial reference, and cell information are set automatically based on information extracted from the dataset. # Upload the files making up the raster dataset to the resource file_list = [ 'Example_Files/logan1.tif' , 'Example_Files/logan2.tif' , 'Example_Files/logan.vrt' ] new_resource . file_upload ( * file_list ) # Get the aggregation that was just created - initially the title will be \"logan1\" # based on the name of the first .tif file that appears in the .vrt file agg = new_resource . aggregation ( title = \"logan1\" ) # Print the title for the aggregation that was added to the resource print ( 'The following aggregation was added to the resource: ' + agg . metadata . title ) print ( 'Aggregation type: ' + agg . metadata . type ) Multidimensional NetCDF Aggregation Multidimensional aggregations are created in HydroShare from a NetCDF file. Like the other aggregation types, you can upload the NetCDF file and HydroShare will automatically create the aggregation for you. HydroShare also automatically extracts metadata from the NetCDF file to populate the aggregation metadata. Some of this metadata may get propagated to the resource level if you haven't set things like the title and keywords. You can then get the aggregation and set the other metadata elements as shown above for the single file aggregation. # Upload the NetCDF file to the resource new_resource . file_upload ( 'Example_Files/SWE_time.nc' ) # Get the aggregation by searching for the NetCDF file that is inside of it agg = new_resource . aggregation ( file__name = \"SWE_time.nc\" ) # Print the title for the aggregation that was added to the resource print ( 'The following aggregation was added to the resource: ' + agg . metadata . title ) print ( 'Aggregation type: ' + agg . metadata . type ) Time Series Aggregation Time series aggregations are created in HydroShare from an ODM2 SQLite database file. The ODM2 SQLite database contain one or more time series # Upload the SQLite file to the resource new_resource . file_upload ( 'Example_Files/ODM2.sqlite' ) # Get the aggregation by searching for the SQLite file that is inside of it agg = new_resource . aggregation ( file__name = \"ODM2.sqlite\" ) # Print the title for the aggregation that was added to the resource print ( 'The following aggregation was added to the resource: ' + agg . metadata . title ) print ( 'Aggregation type: ' + agg . metadata . type ) File Set Aggregation A file set aggregation is any folder within a resource to which you want to add metadata. If you want to create a file set aggregation, you first have to create a folder, then upload files to it. After that, you can set the aggregation on the folder. # Create a new folder for the file set aggregation new_resource . folder_create ( 'Fileset_Aggregation' ) # Add some files to the folder new_resource . file_upload ( 'Example_Files/Data_File1.csv' , 'Example_Files/Data_File2.csv' , destination_path = 'Fileset_Aggregation' ) # TODO: How to set a fileset aggregation on a folder containing files? Get Aggregation Properties Each aggregation in a resource has metadata properties associated with it. You can query/retrieve those properties for display.

If you want to download it to a particular location on your disk, you can pass a path to the location where you want the aggregation to be saved to the download() function as a string.

There are two functions you can use to do this. The difference between the two is whether the aggregation's content files are preserved in the resource or deleted. To remove the aggregation-specific metadata and associations while maintaining the content files, call the remove() function on the aggregation. # Get the geographic raster aggregation that was created above agg = new_resource . aggregation ( title = \"logan1\" ) # Remove the aggregation and delete its metadata, but leave the file(s) new_resource . aggregation_remove ( agg ) If you want to delete the aggregation, including its metadata and the associated content files, you can call the delete() function on the aggregation. Once you have called the remove() function on an aggregation, the delete() function will no longer work and you will have to delete the files individually. # Get the multidimensional NetCDF aggregation that was created above agg = new_resource . aggregation ( type = \"NetCDF\" ) # Delete the aggregation and metadata along with files within aggregation new_resource . aggregation_delete ( agg )","title":"Aggregation Operations"},{"location":"examples/Aggregation_Operations/#hs-rdf-hydroshare-python-client-resource-aggregation-operation-examples","text":"The following code snippets show examples for how to use the HS RDF HydroShare Python Client to manipulate aggregations of known content types in HydroShare.

The search_aggregations argument tells the client whether you want to look at all of the files in the resource ( search_aggregations=True ) or if you want to want to only look at files that do not belong to a content aggregation ( search_aggregations=False ). # Print the title of the resource and the list of files it contains print ( 'Working on: ' + new_resource . metadata . title ) print ( 'File list:' ) for file in new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ): print ( file . name ) Adding Files to a Resource You may need to add content files to your resource. The examples here upload files from the Example_Files folder that is included with the HydroShare resource that contains these Jupyter Notebook examples. If you are running in your own local Python environment and want to load files from your local machine, you would specify the path to the file(s) on your hard drive. If you want to upload multiple files at once, you can pass multiple file paths separated by commas to the upload() function. Note that if you upload files that already exist, those files will be overwritten. # Upload one or more files to your resource new_resource . file_upload ( 'Example_Files/Data_File1.csv' , 'Example_Files/Data_File2.csv' ) # Print the names of the files in the resource print ( 'Updated file list after adding a file: ' ) for file in new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ): print ( file . path ) HydroShare also allows you to create a folder heirarchy within your resource. You can use this functionality to keep your content organized, just as you would on your own computer. You can upload files to specific folders within the resource. Paths to folders are specified relative to the \"content\" directory of the resource. # First create a new folder new_resource . folder_create ( 'New_Folder' ) # Upload one or more files to a specific folder within a resource new_resource . file_upload ( 'Example_Files/Data_File2.csv' , destination_path = 'New_Folder' ) # Print the names of the files in the resource print ( 'Updated file list after adding a file: ' ) for file in new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ): print ( file . path ) Searching for Files within a Resource If you need to find/get one or more files within a resource so you can download or remove it from the resource, there are several filters available that allow you to return a list of files that meet your search criteria or a single file. Get a List of Files Execute a filter to return a list of files within the resource that meet the search critera. # Get a list of all of the files in the resource that are not part of an aggregation file_list = new_resource . files () print ( 'All files that are not part of an aggregation:' ) print ( * file_list , sep = ' \\n ' ) print ( ' \\n ' ) # Get a list of all of the files in the resource inclusive of files that are inside # content type aggregations file_list = new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ) print ( 'All files in the resource:' ) print ( * file_list , sep = ' \\n ' ) print ( ' \\n ' ) # Get a list of all of the files within a folder in the resource # Note that you have to pass the full relative path to the folder you are searching # because there may be multiple folders within a resource with the same name. # To get files in the root folder, pass an empty string (folder=\"\") file_list = new_resource . files ( folder = \"New_Folder\" ) print ( 'All files within a specific folder:' ) print ( * file_list , sep = ' \\n ' ) print ( ' \\n ' ) # Get a list of all files that have a specific extension. This searches all folders file_list = new_resource . files ( extension = \".csv\" ) print ( 'All files with a .csv file extension:' ) print ( * file_list , sep = ' \\n ' ) print ( ' \\n ' ) # Filters can be combined # Get a list of all files in a particular folder that have a specific extension file_list = new_resource . files ( folder = \"New_Folder\" , extension = \".csv\" ) print ( 'All files with a .csv file extension in a particular folder:' ) print ( * file_list , sep = ' \\n ' ) Search for a Single File Execute a filter to look for a single file in the resource that meets the search critera. # Get a single file using its path relative to the resource content directory file = new_resource . file ( path = \"New_Folder/Data_File2.csv\" ) print ( 'File retrieved using path:' ) print ( file ) print ( ' \\n ' ) # Get a single file using its name # Note that if you have multiple files in your resource with the same name, but in different # folders, you should search for a particular file using the path parameter to ensure that # you get the right file file = new_resource . file ( name = \"Data_File2.csv\" ) print ( 'File retrieved using name:' ) print ( file ) Get the Properties of a File When you use the filters to return a file from a resource, you get back a file object that holds properties of the file. # Search for a file within a resource file = new_resource . file ( path = \"New_Folder/Data_File2.csv\" ) # Print the properties of the file print ( 'File name: ' + file . name ) print ( 'File extension:' + file . extension ) print ( 'File folder name: ' + file . folder ) print ( 'File path: ' + file . path ) print ( 'File url_path: ' + file . url ) #print('File checksum:' + file.checksum) # TODO: The checksum property is not implemented yet Renaming and Moving Files You may need to rename or move files once they have been added to a resource. First get the file object and then rename or move it. # Get a file to rename - use the relative path to the file to make sure you have the right one file = new_resource . file ( path = \"Data_File2.csv\" ) # Rename the file to whatever you want new_resource . file_rename ( file , 'Data_File2_Renamed.csv' ) # Print the names of the files in the resource print ( 'Updated file list after adding a file: ' ) for file in new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ): print ( file . path ) Moving files is similar to renaming. Instead of just changing the file name, change the relative path of the file to move it to the new location within the resource. # Get a file to move file = new_resource . file ( path = \"Data_File1.csv\" ) # Move the file to a different folder new_resource . file_rename ( file , 'New_Folder/Data_File1.csv' ) # Print the names of the files in the resource print ( 'Updated file list after adding a file: ' ) for file in new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ): print ( file . path ) Downloading Files from a Resource You can download individual files from an existing HydroShare resource. You can use the filters shown above to specify which file(s) you want to download. When you call the download() function on an individual file, you can pass a path where you want to save the file as a string. Leaving the path blank downloads the files to the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook. # Download a single file from a resource # Note that if you have multiple files within the same resource that have the same name, # and you want a particular file, you need to specify the relative path to the specific file file = new_resource . file ( path = 'New_Folder/Data_File1.csv' ) new_resource . file_download ( file ) If you want to, you can clean up the file that was just downloaded by deleting it using a terminal command. ! rm 'Data_File1.csv' Removing Files from a Resource You can also delete files from a resource. In this example, I remove one of the files I added to the resource above. You have to delete each individual file. Make sure you call delete using the path parameter to make sure you are deleting the right file. # Specify the file you want to delete file = new_resource . file ( path = \"New_Folder/Data_File2.csv\" ) new_resource . file_delete ( file ) # Print the names of the files in the resource print ( \"Updated file list after removing file: \" ) for file in new_resource . files ( search_aggregations = True ): print ( file . path ) TODO: The following items are being worked on Delete a folder and all of the files within it.

Install the HS RDF HydroShare Python Client The HS RDF Python Client for HydroShare won't be installed by default, so it has to be installed first before you can work with it. Use the following command to install the Python Client from the GitHub repository. Eventually we will distribute this package via the Python Package Index (PyPi) so that it can be installed via pip from PyPi. ! pip install hsclient Authenticate with HydroShare Before you start interacting with resources in HydroShare you will need to authenticate. from hsclient import HydroShare hs = HydroShare () hs . sign_in () Create a New Empty Resource A \"resource\" is a container for your content in HydroShare. Think of it as a \"working directory\" into which you are going to organize the code and/or data you are using and want to share. The following code can be used to create a new, empty resource within which you can create content and metadata. This code creates a new resource in HydroShare. It also creates an in-memory object representation of that resource in your local environmment that you can then manipulate with further code. # Create the new, empty resource new_resource = hs . create () # Get the HydroShare identifier for the new resource resIdentifier = new_resource . resource_id print ( 'The HydroShare Identifier for your new resource is: ' + resIdentifier ) # Construct a hyperlink for the new resource print ( 'Your new resource is available at: ' + new_resource . metadata . url ) Creating and Editing Resource Metadata Elements Editing metadata elements for a resource can be done in an object oriented way. You can specify all of the metadata elements in code, which will set their values in memory in your local environment. Values of metadata elements can be edited, removed, or replaced by setting them to a new value, appending new values (in the case where the metadata element accepts a list), or by removing the value entirely. When you are ready to save edits to metadata elements from your local environment to the resource in HydroShare, you can call the save() function on your resource and all of the new metadata values you created/edited will be saved to the resource in HydroShare. Resource Title and Abstract The Title and Abstract metadata elements can be specified as text strings. To modify the Title or Abstract after it has been set, just set them to a different value. # Set the Title for the resource new_resource . metadata . title = 'Resource for Testing the HS RDF HydroShare Python Client' # Set the Abstract text for the resource new_resource . metadata . abstract = ( 'This resource was created as a demonstration of using the HS RDF ' 'Python Client for HydroShare. Once you have completed all of the ' 'steps in this notebook, you will have a fully populated HydroShare ' 'Resource.' ) # Call the save function to save the metadata edits to HydroShare new_resource . save () # Print the title just added to the resource print ( 'Title: ' + new_resource . metadata . title ) print ( 'Abstract: ' + new_resource . metadata . abstract ) Subject Keywords Subject keywords can be specified as a Python list of strings. Keywords can be added by creating a list, appending new keywords to the existing list, or by overriding the existing list with a new one. # Create subject keywords for the resource using a list of strings new_resource . metadata . subjects = [ 'HS RDF' , 'Python' , 'HydroShare' , 'Another Keyword' ] # New keywords can be appended to the existing list new_resource . metadata . subjects . append ( 'Hydroinformatics' ) # Keywords can be removed by removing them from the list new_resource . metadata . subjects . remove ( 'Another Keyword' ) # Save the changes to the resource in HydroShare new_resource . save () # Print the keywords for the resource print ( 'The list of keywords for the resource includes:' ) for keyword in new_resource . metadata . subjects : print ( keyword ) Spatial and Temporal Coverage Initially the spatial and temporal coverage for a resource are empty. To set them, you have to create a coverage object of the right type and set the spatial or temporal coverage to that object. # Import the required metadata classes for coverage objects from hsmodels.schemas.fields import BoxCoverage , PointCoverage , PeriodCoverage from datetime import datetime # Set the spatial coverage to a BoxCoverage object new_resource . metadata . spatial_coverage = BoxCoverage ( name = 'Logan, Utah' , northlimit = 41.7910 , eastlimit =- 111.7664 , southlimit = 41.6732 , westlimit =- 111.9079 , projection = 'WGS 84 EPSG:4326' , type = 'box' , units = 'Decimal degrees' ) # You can remove the spatial coverage element by setting it to None new_resource . metadata . spatial_coverage = None # If you want to set the spatial coverage to a PointCoverage instead new_resource . metadata . spatial_coverage = PointCoverage ( name = 'Logan, Utah' , north = 41.7371 , east =- 111.8351 , projection = 'WGS 84 EPSG:4326' , type = 'point' , units = 'Decimal degrees' ) # Create a beginning and ending date for a time period beginDate = datetime . strptime ( '2020-12-01T00:00:00Z' , '%Y-%m- %d T%H:%M:%S %f Z' ) endDate = datetime . strptime ( '2020-12-31T00:00:00Z' , '%Y-%m- %d T%H:%M:%S %f Z' ) # Set the temporal coverage of the resource to a PeriodCoverage object new_resource . metadata . period_coverage = PeriodCoverage ( start = beginDate , end = endDate ) # Save the changes to the resource in HydroShare new_resource . save () # Print the temporal coverage information print ( 'Temporal Coverage' ) print ( new_resource . metadata . period_coverage ) # Print the spatial coverage information print ( ' \\n Spatial Coverage' ) print ( new_resource . metadata . spatial_coverage ) Additional/Extended Metadata HydroShare allows you to create new, extended metadata elements for a HydroShare resource as key-value pairs. You can add new elements, edit existing elements, or remove these elements. Extended metadata elements are stored in the resource as a Python dictionary. # Add an extended metadata element as a key-value pair new_resource . metadata . additional_metadata [ 'New Element Key' ] = 'Text value of new element key.' # Remove an individual key-value pair using its key del new_resource . metadata . additional_metadata [ 'New Element Key' ] # Or, you can clear out all of the additional metadata elements that might exist new_resource . metadata . additional_metadata . clear () # Add multiple key-value pairs at once using a Python dictionary new_resource . metadata . additional_metadata = { 'Observed Variable' : 'Oxygen, dissolved' , 'Site Location' : 'Located on downstream side of river bridge' , 'Observation Depth' : '1 meter' } # Save the changes to the resource in HydroShare new_resource . save () # Print the extended metadata elements for the resource print ( 'The extended metadata elements for the resource include:' ) for key , value in new_resource . metadata . additional_metadata . items (): print ( key + ':' , value ) Sources Sources are stored as a list of strings. Sources can be added or removed by adding or removing source strings from the list. # If you have existing Sources in your resource, you can remove all of them # by clearing the local list and then saving the resource new_resource . metadata . sources . clear () new_resource . save () # Add a Source to the resource sourceString = ( 'Mihalevich, B.

Because of this, Related Resources are stored as a list of Relation objects. To create a new Related Resource, you have to first instantiate a Relation object and then add it to the list of Related Resources. # Import the required metadata class for a Relation object from hsmodels.schemas.fields import Relation from hsmodels.schemas.enums import RelationType # If you have existing Related Resources, you can remove all of them # by clearing the local list and then saving the resource new_resource . metadata . relations . clear () new_resource . save () # Create a new relation object newRelation = Relation ( type = RelationType . isDataFor , value = ( 'Bastidas Pacheco, C.

You can create multiple funding agency entries for a resource, which get stored as a Python list. # Import the required metadata class for an AwardInfo object from hsmodels.schemas.fields import AwardInfo # If you have existing funding agency information, you can remove all of them # by clearing the local list and then saving the resource new_resource . metadata . awards . clear () new_resource . save () # Create a new AwardInfo object newAwardInfo = AwardInfo ( funding_agency_name = 'National Science Foundation' , title = ( 'Collaborative Research: Elements: Advancing Data Science ' 'and Analytics for Water (DSAW)' ), number = 'OAC 1931297' , funding_agency_url = 'https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1931297' ) # Append the new AwardInfo object to the list of funding agencies new_resource . metadata . awards . append ( newAwardInfo ) # Save the changes to the resource in HydroShare new_resource . save () # Print the AwardInfo print ( 'Funding sources added: ' ) for award in new_resource . metadata . awards : print ( 'Award Title: ' + award . title ) Authors In HydroShare, an \"Author\" is the same as the Dublin Core metadata \"Creator\" element. The Creator element is a list of creators for the resource. However, the order of the Creators matters. When setting Creator information for the resource, you need to edit the local list of creators so that it reflects the order you want.
